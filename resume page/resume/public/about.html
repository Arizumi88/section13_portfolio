    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth Dawson. I am a former credentialing specialist, English as a foreign language teacher, 
    overseas nurse recruiter, and stay-at-home mom. I recently spent 14 months in South Korea teaching English and have 
    returned to the states. I had hoped to return to my previous position as a credentialing specialist as promised, but 
    the company I worked with has gone through several rounds of layoffs and downsizing and the market in that field is 
    coming down from the post-covid bloat so I have decided to switch careers.
    </p>

    <p>I do not have an extensive history in tech. I started getting into web design while I was still at university during 
    the pandemic. However, that became a neglected side project when the semester started up again, then I graduated, then
    I ended up in recruitment and project management. It's something that has always interested me but other priorities 
    have prevented me from giving it another shot. But in my downtime while job searching, I realized I would much rather 
    learn a new skill to get into a career I would be more likely to enjoy than keep banging my head against a wall fighting
    to get back into a career that I know won't be fun.
    </p>

    <p>I may not have the work history on my resume to demonstrate what kind of employee I am, but I do have the track record 
    of returning to school as a single parent to provide better for my son and follow my own dream. I overcame agoraphobia 
    and PTSD and dedicated 7 years of my life to being able to teach overseas, I dream I'd had since I was a teenager. I 
    have dedicated everything I have to being the best role model and caregiver I could be to my son. I went back to school 
    and sat in classrooms every day as the only person over 21 to complete my degree. And all of this during a world-wide 
    pandemic. I know how to set goals and achieve them every time. Did I mention during that time I also lost and kept off 
    a hundred pounds? And quit smoking. All of this after being put on social security because my doctors thought I would 
    never recover enough to be able to work long-term and take care of myself. And now I have decided to become a software 
    developer, so, of course, that's what I'm going to be. And I'm excited to see where I'll be in another year. 
    The sky's the limit!
